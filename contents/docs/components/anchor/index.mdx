## Overview

The `Anchor` component is used for navigation links across the application. It wraps the `Link` component from Next.js and adds additional functionality, such as handling active states, allowing for absolute path matching, and supporting a disabled state. This component makes it easier to manage internal routing with added flexibility.

### Features:
- Conditional rendering based on the current route (activeClassName).
- Supports both absolute and relative path matching.
- Optional disabled state, which prevents users from interacting with the link.

## Props

| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `absolute`       | `boolean`                    | Whether to match the link path absolutely (`true`) or allow partial matches (`false`). |
| `activeClassName`| `string`                     | Adds the specified class when the link is active.                                      |
| `disabled`       | `boolean`                    | Renders the link in a disabled state, preventing interaction.                         |
| `className`      | `string`                     | Additional classes for styling the link.                                               |
| `children`       | `React.ReactNode`            | The content inside the link.                                                          |
| `...props`       | `ComponentProps<typeof Link>`| Inherits all other props from the `Link` component in Next.js.                         |
