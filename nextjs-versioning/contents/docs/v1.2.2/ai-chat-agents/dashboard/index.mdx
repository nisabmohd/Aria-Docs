## Lead Integration in Chat Logs

### Embedded View
Rather than a separate panel, lead data is dynamically displayed inside the Chat Logs panel if available during conversation.

### How It Works
- When a user submits lead info (name, email, phone), it shows on the side within the same chat view.
- Also includes metadata like IP address, country, and city.

### Benefit
Users can analyze the lead's path from conversation to conversion without switching panels.
